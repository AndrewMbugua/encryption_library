### Custom Cryptography Library

name -> custom_crypto_lib


This is a work in progress as I try to build towards my own custom encryption library in C.

Ceaser Cipher, you shift the letters towards by 3
Vigen√®re Cipher you shift right using the values given by the key

Mersenne Twister(MT) - is a non-cryptographic Pseudorandom Number Generators(PRNG)
MT will generate uniformly random bits without statistical bias,but its predictable,given a few bits produced by MT its easy enough to tell which bits will follow.
